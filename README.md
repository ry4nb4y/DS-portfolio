[**Paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/2009JD013741.pdf) giving a full description of an automated custom algorithm using speech-recognition techniques to synthesize paleoclimate records from a [laser scattering map](http://icecube.berkeley.edu/~bay/dustmap/) of South Pole ice.

Monte Carlo simulation of photon propagation in heterogenous ice ([**cyl.c**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/cyl.c)) used in original [**paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/GRL2001.pdf) describing the invention of the dustlogger.  [**Paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/t13J068.pdf) explaining how the dustlogger laser probe is used to [map dust](http://icecube.berkeley.edu/~bay/dustmap/) in deep glacial boreholes.  

Data mining of large databases for neutrinos arriving in correlation with extra-galactic explosions.  [**PhD thesis**] (https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/bay_thesis.pdf).  [**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05390) describing machine techniques for neutrino experiments.

[**Paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/2009JD013741.pdf) using Monte Carlo methods and original data to determine statistical significance of a correlation of volcanism with climate change over 70,000 years.
