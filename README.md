[**Paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/2009JD013741.pdf) giving a full describing of an automated custom algorithm using speech-recognition techniques to synthesize paleoclimate records from a [laser scattering map](http://icecube.berkeley.edu/~bay/dustmap/) of South Pole ice.

[**Paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/t13J068.pdf) explaining how the dustlogger laser probe is used to map dust in deep glacial boreholes.

[**Paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/GRL2001.pdf) describing the invention of the dustlogger probe published in Geophysical Research Letters.  The Monte Carlo used in the analysis is a detailed simulation of photon propagation in heterogenous ice ([cyl.c](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/cyl.c)).
