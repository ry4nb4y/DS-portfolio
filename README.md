[**Paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/2009JD013741.pdf) giving a full description of an *automated custom algorithm using speech-recognition* techniques to synthesize paleoclimate records from a [laser scattering map](http://icecube.berkeley.edu/~bay/dustmap/) of South Pole ice.

*Monte Carlo simulation* of photon propagation in heterogenous ice ([**cyl.c**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/cyl.c)) This MC analysis is used in original [**paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/GRL2001.pdf) describing the invention of the dustlogger.  [**Paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/t13J068.pdf) explaining how the dustlogger laser probe is used to [map dust](http://icecube.berkeley.edu/~bay/dustmap/) in deep ice sheets.  

*Data mining* of large databases for neutrinos arriving in correlation with extra-galactic explosions.<br>
[**PhD thesis**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/bay_thesis.pdf).<br>
[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05390) describing general machine techniques for neutrino experiments.

[**Paper**](https://github.com/ry4nb4y/DS-portfolio/blob/master/2009JD013741.pdf) using original data and *Monte Carlo methods to determine statistical significance* of a correlation of volcanism with climate change over 70,000 years.
